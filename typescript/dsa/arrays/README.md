# Arrays

## Summary

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures. They provide constant-time access by index
and are widely used in algorithms and system-level code.

They are useful for:

- Storing ordered data
- Efficient lookups by index
- Sliding window, prefix sum, and two-pointer techniques
